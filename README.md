# Atriumn Issue-Driven Development

An AI-powered development pipeline that turns GitHub issues into complete, production-ready code using a robust, PR-centric workflow.

## How It Works

Atriumn transforms the software development lifecycle by leveraging an AI agent orchestrated through native GitHub features. The entire process is tracked in a single Pull Request, providing a clear, auditable history from issue creation to merged code.

1.  **Start with an Issue**: A developer creates a GitHub issue and triggers the pipeline with a simple comment: `/atriumn-research`.
2.  **Automated Setup**: The Atriumn GitHub App instantly creates a feature branch and a **Draft Pull Request**. This PR becomes the central hub for the entire task.
3.  **Phased Execution**: The AI agent executes the development process in four distinct, gated phases:
    *   **Research**: The AI analyzes the codebase and commits a detailed research document to the PR.
    *   **Plan**: After human approval, the AI generates and commits a complete implementation plan.
    *   **Implement**: With the plan approved, the AI writes the code, creates tests, and pushes commits to the PR.
    *   **Validate**: The AI runs final checks against the code to ensure it meets the plan's success criteria.
4.  **Gated Approvals**: Progress between phases is controlled by formal **GitHub PR Reviews**. A developer simply clicks "Approve" on the PR to advance the pipeline.
5.  **Real-Time Status**: Each phase is represented by a **GitHub Status Check** on the PR, giving everyone instant visibility into the AI's progress.

## Features

-   ‚úÖ **PR-Centric Workflow**: All activity‚Äîcode, artifacts, approvals, and status‚Äîis centralized in a single Pull Request.
-   üîí **Native Approvals**: Uses GitHub's own secure and auditable PR Review system for human gates.
-   üìä **Live Status Checks**: Real-time visibility into the AI's progress directly on the PR.
-   üöÄ **One-Click Onboarding**: Install the GitHub App, and it will automatically create a PR to set up your repository.
-   üîß **Highly Configurable**: Customize validation rules, test commands, and more for each repository.

## Getting Started (One-Click Installation)

1.  **Install the GitHub App**: Install the "Atriumn Issue-Driven Development" app on your chosen repositories.
2.  **Merge the Onboarding PR**: The app will automatically create a Pull Request titled "üöÄ Configure Atriumn Issue-Driven Development". Review and merge it.
3.  **Start Developing**: Create a GitHub issue and comment `/atriumn-research` to kick off your first AI-driven development cycle!

## Workflow Safety & Management

### The Challenge

When AI agents like Claude implement features, they often need to create or modify GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD, testing, or deployment. However, allowing an AI to directly modify `.github/workflows/` poses significant risks:

- **Accidental breakage**: AI could unintentionally break critical CI/CD pipelines
- **Security concerns**: Workflows have access to secrets and can perform sensitive operations
- **Unexpected changes**: AI might modify existing workflows in ways that disrupt team processes

### Our Solution: Suggested Workflows

Atriumn implements a **workflow safety mechanism** that protects your existing CI/CD setup while still allowing Claude to propose helpful workflow improvements:

1. **Automatic Detection**: When Claude creates new workflow files during implementation, the pipeline automatically detects them
2. **Safe Storage**: New workflows are moved to `.atriumn/suggested-workflows/` instead of `.github/workflows/`
3. **Preservation**: Existing workflows remain untouched and continue running normally
4. **Tracking Issues**: The pipeline automatically creates a GitHub issue to track and review suggested workflows
5. **Human Control**: You review and manually activate workflows when ready

### How It Works

When Claude creates a workflow like `visual-testing.yml` for dark mode testing:

```yaml
# Claude creates: .github/workflows/visual-testing.yml
# Pipeline moves it to: .atriumn/suggested-workflows/visual-testing.yml
# Your existing workflows remain in: .github/workflows/
```

The pipeline then creates a tracking issue with:
- List of suggested workflows with previews
- Clear activation instructions
- Links to the original issue and PR for context

### Activating Suggested Workflows

After reviewing, activate workflows with simple commands:

```bash
# Activate a specific workflow
mv .atriumn/suggested-workflows/visual-testing.yml .github/workflows/

# Activate all suggested workflows
mv .atriumn/suggested-workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/
```

### Benefits

- ‚úÖ **Zero risk**: Existing workflows can't be accidentally broken
- üìã **Full visibility**: All workflow suggestions are tracked in issues
- üéØ **Selective adoption**: Cherry-pick which workflows to activate
- üîç **Review at your pace**: No pressure to immediately adopt AI suggestions
- üîó **Complete context**: Issues link back to the original work

## Architecture

Atriumn is built on a robust, event-driven architecture that combines a GitHub App with reusable GitHub Actions workflows.

-   **The GitHub App**: Acts as the central orchestrator. It listens for installation events, initial triggers (`/atriumn-research`), and PR review approvals. It then dispatches the appropriate workflow.
-   **Reusable Workflow (`development-pipeline.yml`)**: This is the engine that executes each phase. It creates status checks, runs the Claude Code AI agent with the correct "task pack," and commits the results.
-   **Consumer Workflow**: A lightweight workflow in your repository (created by the onboarding PR) that simply receives the `workflow_dispatch` events from the app.

This design ensures logic is centralized and updated in one place, while consumer repositories remain clean and easy to manage.
