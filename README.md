## Phase 1: Validation Scripts (Current)

### Research Phase (`validate-research.sh`)
Validates research documents with the following checks:
- YAML frontmatter with required fields (date, researcher, topic, status)
- Required sections (Research Question, Summary, Detailed Findings, Code References, Architecture Insights)
- Minimum number of file references (configurable, default: 3)
- No placeholder text (TODO, FIXME, etc.)

### Planning Phase (`validate-plan.sh`)
Validates implementation plans ensuring:
- YAML frontmatter completeness
- Required sections (Implementation Approach, Phase structure)
- Proper success criteria with Automated and Manual verification sections
- No unresolved questions or TODOs
- Clear phase breakdown (Phase 1, Phase 2, etc.)

### Implementation Phase (`validate-implementation.sh`)
Validates implementation readiness:
- Branch exists and has commits ahead of base branch
- All configured test commands pass (make test, npm run lint, etc.)
- No merge conflicts with base branch
- Decision record updated with implementation details

### Pull Request Phase (`validate-pr.sh`)
Final PR validation:
- PR exists and has proper description structure
- Links to research and plan documents
- Reviewers assigned
- All status checks passing
- Proper branch naming convention

## Configuration Files

- **`default.yml`**: Base configuration template for new projects
- **`curatefor.me.yml`**: Environment-specific configuration for CurateFor.me
- **`schema.yml`**: JSON schema for validating configuration files

## Templates

- **`decision-record-template.md`**: Standardized template for documenting architectural and technical decisions

## Usage

### Prerequisites

Install required dependencies:
```bash
# Install yq for YAML processing
brew install yq  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install yq  # Ubuntu

# Install GitHub CLI for PR validation
brew install gh  # macOS
# or
sudo apt-get install gh  # Ubuntu
```

### Using Validation Scripts

```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Validate research document
./scripts/validate-research.sh thoughts/shared/research/my-research.md

# Validate implementation plan  
./scripts/validate-plan.sh thoughts/shared/plans/my-plan.md

# Validate implementation on branch
./scripts/validate-implementation.sh feature/issue-123-my-feature

# Validate PR
./scripts/validate-pr.sh 123

# Use custom config file
./scripts/validate-research.sh .github/dev-config.yml thoughts/shared/research/my-research.md

# Get help for any script
./scripts/validate-research.sh --help
```

### Configuration Setup

Create `.github/development-pipeline-config.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
repo_name: "my-repo"
base_branch: "main"
thoughts_directory: "docs/"

validation:
  research_min_refs: 5
  plan_required_sections:
    - "## Implementation Approach"
    - "## Phase"
    - "#### Automated Verification:"
    - "#### Manual Verification:"
  implementation_test_commands:
    - "npm test"
    - "npm run lint"
    - "npm run typecheck"

team:
  default_reviewers: ["@team-lead"]
  
notifications:
  slack_channel: "#dev-team"
  escalation_hours: 2
```

If no config file is found, scripts will use `configs/default.yml`.

### Using Templates

1. Copy templates from `templates/` directory
2. Fill in project-specific information
3. Follow the structured format provided

### Testing

```bash
# Run all validation script tests
./test/test-validation-scripts.sh

# Run specific tests
./test/test-validation-scripts.sh research
./test/test-validation-scripts.sh plan
./test/test-validation-scripts.sh help
./test/test-validation-scripts.sh deps
```

```

#### 3. Workflow Events

The workflow responds to these GitHub events:

- **`issue_comment`**: Pipeline triggers and phase completions
- **`pull_request`**: PR validation and completion
- **`workflow_dispatch`**: Manual testing

### Pipeline Modes

#### ðŸ¤– **Fully Automated Mode**
```bash
@claude run development pipeline
- Human validation: false
```
- Proceeds automatically through all phases
- No human approval required
- Uses validation scripts for quality gates

#### ðŸ‘¥ **Human Approval Mode** (Default)
```bash
@claude run development pipeline
- Human validation: true
```
- Pauses for human review at each phase
- Requires explicit approval to proceed
- Provides validation reports for review

### Testing the Pipeline

#### Manual Testing

Use the test workflow for validation:

```bash
# In GitHub Actions
- Workflow: "Test Development Pipeline"
- Scenarios: 
  * full-pipeline-automated
  * full-pipeline-manual  
  * research-only
  * validation-failure
```

#### Expected Workflow

1. **Issue Comment**: `@claude run development pipeline`
2. **Branch Creation**: `feature/issue-123-description`
3. **Research Phase**: Document creation and validation
4. **Planning Phase**: Implementation plan and approval
5. **Implementation Phase**: Code changes and testing
6. **PR Creation**: Automated PR with full context
7. **PR Validation**: Review and merge process
8. **Completion**: Issue closure and cleanup

### Monitoring and Observability

#### Decision Records

Each pipeline run creates a comprehensive decision record:

```
thoughts/shared/decisions/pipeline-issue-123.md
```

Contains:
- Issue context and branch information
- Phase completion timestamps
- Validation results and metrics  
- Implementation statistics
- Final completion summary

#### GitHub Integration

- **Issue Labels**: `branch:feature/issue-123-description`
- **PR Links**: Automatic linking to research/plan documents
- **Status Comments**: Real-time progress updates
- **Metrics**: Commit counts, file changes, duration

### Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

1. **Branch Creation Fails**
   - Check repository permissions
   - Verify base branch exists
   - Ensure GITHUB_TOKEN has write access

2. **Validation Script Errors**
   - Verify yq and gh CLI are available
   - Check document structure and content
   - Review validation script output

3. **Human Approval Stalled**
   - Use exact approval phrases: `approve research`
   - Check notification settings
   - Review decision record for context

#### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check pipeline branch
gh issue view 123 --json labels

# Validate documents manually  
./scripts/validate-research.sh thoughts/shared/research/doc.md
./scripts/validate-plan.sh thoughts/shared/plans/plan.md

# Test PR validation
./scripts/validate-pr.sh 456
```

## Phase 3: Branch Safety & Context Preservation

Phase 3 introduces enterprise-grade reliability features for the development pipeline:

### Enhanced Branch Management
- **Branch Safety Checks**: Validates pipeline branches exist and are properly tracked
- **State Validation**: Ensures branch state consistency with pipeline expectations
- **Automatic Recovery**: Handles branch deletions and corruption

### Context Preservation
- **Decision Records**: Comprehensive tracking of pipeline state and decisions
- **Phase Context Validation**: Ensures each phase has proper prerequisites
- **Document Integrity**: Validates required documents exist and are well-formed

### Error Recovery
- **Automatic Failure Detection**: Analyzes failures and provides recovery guidance
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Phase-specific retry commands for common failure scenarios
- **Complete Pipeline Restart**: Clean restart capability with context preservation

### Partial Completion Handling
- **Completion Analysis**: Detects 75%-25% scenarios and other partial implementations
- **Human Decision Points**: Clear options for proceeding with partial work
- **Intelligent Continuation**: Preserves completed work while finishing remaining items

### Enhanced Commands

```bash
# Enhanced pipeline with all Phase 3 features
@claude run development pipeline

# Error recovery commands
@claude retry research        # Retry research phase after failure
@claude retry planning        # Retry planning phase
@claude retry implementation  # Retry implementation phase
@claude restart pipeline     # Complete pipeline restart

# Partial completion decisions
continue implementing remaining items  # Continue with remaining work
accept current implementation         # Create PR with current state
modify implementation: [changes]      # Modify scope and continue
```

### Decision Record Management

```bash
# Analyze decision record size and health
python scripts/manage-decision-record.py thoughts/shared/decisions/pipeline-issue-123.md --action analyze

# Automatic size management
python scripts/manage-decision-record.py thoughts/shared/decisions/pipeline-issue-123.md --auto

# Manual compression for readability
python scripts/manage-decision-record.py thoughts/shared/decisions/pipeline-issue-123.md --action compress

# Create summary version with archived details
python scripts/manage-decision-record.py thoughts/shared/decisions/pipeline-issue-123.md --action summarize
```

### Using Enhanced Workflows

1. **Copy the enhanced template:**
   ```bash
   cp templates/enhanced-repo-workflow-template.yml .github/workflows/development-pipeline-enhanced.yml
   ```

2. **Start enhanced pipeline:**
   ```bash
   # Comment on GitHub issue
   @claude run development pipeline
   ```

3. **Enhanced features automatically provide:**
