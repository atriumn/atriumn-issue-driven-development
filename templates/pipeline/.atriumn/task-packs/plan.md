# Implementation Planning (Single-Session, File-Backed)

You are the PLANNING COORDINATOR for this run.

Allowed tools only: Read, Grep, Glob, LS, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, TodoWrite  
Disallowed: Bash/shell, MCP/CLI/web/Linear/external calls.  
Do everything **inside this one session**.

## Inputs (provided below the prompt)
- `feature_ref`
- `issue_number`
- `repository`
- `task_description`
- `phase`
- `action`

## Process (follow **in order**)

1) **Read complete pipeline context first**
   - Read: `thoughts/shared/decisions/issue-${issue_number}.md`
   - Read: `thoughts/shared/research/issue-${issue_number}.md`
   - Understand the architectural decisions from research phase

2) **Analyze and decompose the planning requirements**
   - Break down the task into clear implementation phases
   - Use `TodoWrite` to create a planning approach

3) **Create detailed plan** at `thoughts/shared/plans/issue-${issue_number}.md`

# Implementation Plan: ${task_description}

## Current State Analysis
- Summary of current implementation with file:line references
- Key components identified in research
- Existing patterns and conventions

## Desired End State
- Clear specification of what will be built
- User-facing functionality
- Technical architecture changes

## What We're NOT Doing
- Explicit scope boundaries to prevent scope creep
- Features/changes that are out of scope
- Technical debt that won't be addressed

## Phased Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: [Name]
- **Goal**: [specific objective]
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Task 1 with specific file references
  - [ ] Task 2 with expected changes
- **Success Criteria**: Clear, testable outcomes

### Phase 2: [Name]
- **Goal**: [specific objective]
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Task 1 with specific file references
  - [ ] Task 2 with expected changes
- **Success Criteria**: Clear, testable outcomes

## Testing Strategy

### Automated Verification:
- [ ] Tests pass: `make test` (or appropriate command)
- [ ] Linting passes: `make lint`
- [ ] Type checking passes: `make typecheck`
- [ ] Unit tests for new functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for modified workflows

### Manual Verification:
- [ ] Feature works correctly in UI
- [ ] Performance acceptable under load
- [ ] Edge cases handled properly
- [ ] User experience meets requirements

## Migration Notes
- Any data migration requirements
- Backwards compatibility considerations
- Rollback procedures if needed

## Technical Considerations
- Security implications
- Performance impact
- Monitoring and observability
- Documentation updates needed

## Dependencies
- External libraries or services
- Infrastructure changes
- Team coordination required

## Timeline Estimates
- Phase 1: [timeframe]
- Phase 2: [timeframe]
- Total: [timeframe]

## Risk Assessment
- Technical risks and mitigation strategies
- Business risks and fallback plans
- Dependencies that could cause delays

4) **Update decision record with planning decisions**
   - Add planning phase completion to `thoughts/shared/decisions/issue-${issue_number}.md`
   - Include key architectural decisions
   - Document any changes from research recommendations

## Guardrails
- Read research document completely before planning
- Use `TodoWrite` for planning approach
- Include phased implementation with clear success criteria
- Split success criteria into Automated vs Manual verification
- No unresolved open questions in final plan
- Ensure `thoughts/shared/plans/issue-${issue_number}.md` exists and is comprehensive
