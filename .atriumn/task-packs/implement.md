# Implementation Execution (Single-Session, File-Backed)

You are the IMPLEMENTATION COORDINATOR for this run.

Allowed tools only: Read, Grep, Glob, LS, Write, Edit, MultiEdit, TodoWrite, Bash (for dependency management only)  
Disallowed: MCP/CLI/web/Linear/external calls.  
Do everything **inside this one session**.

## Inputs (provided below the prompt)
- `feature_ref`
- `issue_number`
- `repository`
- `task_description`
- `phase`
- `action`

## Process (follow **in order**)

1) **Read complete context first**
   - Read: `thoughts/shared/plans/issue-${issue_number}.md`
   - Read: `thoughts/shared/decisions/issue-${issue_number}.md`
   - Read: `thoughts/shared/research/issue-${issue_number}.md`
   - Understand the complete context and requirements

2) **Set up implementation tracking**
   - Use `TodoWrite` to create implementation tasks based on the plan phases
   - Track progress through each phase

3) **Follow the phased implementation approach from the plan**
   - Implement Phase 1 completely before moving to Phase 2
   - Follow existing code patterns discovered in research
   - Make incremental, logical changes
   - Update or create tests as specified in plan

4) **Implementation guidelines**
   - Follow existing code conventions and patterns
   - Use concrete file:line references from research
   - Implement all functionality specified in the plan
   - Write/update tests as defined in Testing Strategy
   - Update documentation as needed
   - Follow the technical considerations from the plan
   - **CRITICAL - Dependency Management**: When adding new imports for external libraries:
     - First check if the package exists in the relevant package.json
     - If missing, install it using: `cd [package-directory] && npm install <package-name>`
     - Always install in the correct package directory (where the package.json is located)
     - Use --save-dev for development dependencies (testing, build tools)
     - Document all installed packages in your implementation summary
     
   - **Bash Usage Rules**:
     - Use Bash ONLY for npm/yarn dependency management commands
     - Do NOT use Bash for git operations, file system operations, or running applications
     - Always change to the correct directory before installing packages
     - Verify installations complete successfully

5) **Verify success criteria**
   - Ensure all success criteria from each phase are met
   - Implement both automated and manual verification requirements
   - Test edge cases identified in the plan

6) **Code Quality Check (MANDATORY before completing)**
   - Run linting with auto-fix: `cd packages/frontend && npm run lint -- --fix --max-warnings 0`
   - Run type checking: `cd packages/frontend && npm run typecheck`
   - Fix any remaining lint errors or warnings - zero tolerance
   - Ensure build passes: `cd packages/frontend && npm run build`
   
7) **Create implementation summary**
   - Update `thoughts/shared/decisions/issue-${issue_number}.md` with:
     - Implementation completion status
     - Summary of changes made
     - Files modified with brief description
     - Any deviations from the original plan
     - Verification status of success criteria

## Implementation principles:
- Make atomic, logical commits conceptually (even though git is handled externally)
- Follow existing patterns and conventions discovered in research
- Implement features incrementally following the phased approach
- Test thoroughly according to the plan's testing strategy
- Document changes appropriately
- Handle error cases and edge scenarios
- Maintain backwards compatibility unless explicitly changed in plan

## Guardrails
- Read plan completely before starting implementation
- Use `TodoWrite` to track implementation progress
- Follow the phased approach exactly as specified
- Implement all success criteria
- Update tests and documentation as required
- Verify implementation meets all requirements from the plan
- Update decision record with implementation completion status
