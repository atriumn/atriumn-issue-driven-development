# Phase 3: Branch Safety & Context Preservation

This document describes the enhanced development pipeline features introduced in Phase 3, which provide bulletproof branch tracking, context preservation, error recovery, and partial completion handling.

## Overview

Phase 3 introduces comprehensive safety mechanisms and context preservation to ensure pipeline integrity and handle complex real-world scenarios including:

- **Branch Safety**: Ensures pipeline branches exist and are properly tracked
- **Context Validation**: Validates that each phase has proper context from previous phases
- **Error Recovery**: Provides retry mechanisms and clear recovery guidance
- **Partial Completion Handling**: Detects and manages 75%-25% completion scenarios
- **Decision Record Management**: Keeps decision records manageable while preserving context

## Features

### 1. Enhanced Branch Management

**Bulletproof branch tracking and validation**

The enhanced pipeline validates that:
- Pipeline branches exist and are properly labeled
- Branches haven't been deleted or corrupted
- Branch state is consistent with pipeline expectations
- Commit history is maintained properly

```yaml
validate-branch-continuity:
  # Ensures pipeline branch exists and is valid
  # Checks branch state against base branch
  # Validates branch labels on issues
```

**Key Benefits:**
- Prevents pipeline failures due to missing branches
- Detects manual branch deletions
- Validates branch state consistency
- Provides clear error messages for branch issues

### 2. Context Validation Between Phases

**Ensures each phase has proper context from previous phases**

The pipeline now validates:
- Decision records exist and are properly structured
- Required documents exist for each phase
- Phase progression is logical and complete
- Document integrity is maintained

```yaml
validate-context-continuity:
  # Validates decision record exists and is well-formed
  # Checks for required documents based on current phase
  # Ensures proper phase progression
```

**Phase-Specific Context Requirements:**
- **Research → Planning**: Research document must exist and be validated
- **Planning → Implementation**: Both research and plan documents required
- **Implementation → PR**: All pipeline documents must be present
- **PR Creation**: Complete context validation

### 3. Enhanced Error Recovery

**Robust error handling and retry mechanisms**

The enhanced pipeline provides:
- Automatic failure detection and analysis
- Clear recovery guidance for common failure scenarios
- Retry mechanisms for each phase
- Complete pipeline restart capability

**Recovery Commands:**
```bash
@claude retry research        # Retry research phase
@claude retry planning        # Retry planning phase  
@claude retry implementation  # Retry implementation phase
@claude restart pipeline     # Complete restart
```

**Failure Analysis:**
- Identifies failure type and cause
- Provides specific recovery instructions
- Maintains decision record context during recovery
- Prevents data loss during retry operations

### 4. Partial Completion Handling

**Detects and manages the 75%-25% scenario and similar partial completions**

The pipeline analyzes implementation completion by:
- Examining files mentioned in the implementation plan
- Checking git history for phase-related commits
- Calculating completion percentage
- Providing human decision points

**Completion Detection:**
```yaml
detect-partial-completion:
  # Analyzes implementation plan phases
  # Checks file modifications against plan requirements
  # Calculates completion percentage
  # Identifies completed vs. remaining items
```

**Human Decision Options:**
- **Continue**: `continue implementing remaining items`
- **Accept**: `accept current implementation` 
- **Modify**: `modify implementation: [specific changes]`
- **Cancel**: `cancel implementation`

### 5. Context Size Management

**Keeps decision records manageable while preserving essential context**

The pipeline automatically manages decision record size through:
- **Compression**: Collapsible sections for completed phases
- **Summarization**: Archive detailed sections, keep essentials
- **Archiving**: Move detailed logs to separate files
- **Backup**: Automatic backups before any modifications

**Size Thresholds:**
- **< 150 lines**: No action needed
- **150-200 lines**: Compression applied (collapsible sections)
- **> 200 lines**: Summarization applied (archive details)

## Implementation Guide

### Using the Enhanced Workflow

1. **Copy the enhanced template to your repository:**
   ```bash
   cp templates/enhanced-repo-workflow-template.yml .github/workflows/development-pipeline-enhanced.yml
   ```

2. **Start a pipeline with enhanced features:**
   ```bash
   @claude run development pipeline
   ```

3. **The enhanced pipeline automatically provides:**
   - Branch safety validation
   - Context preservation
   - Error recovery mechanisms
   - Partial completion detection

### Decision Record Structure

Enhanced decision records maintain this structure:

```markdown
# Development Pipeline Decision Record - Issue #123

## Issue Context
- Issue details and metadata
- Pipeline configuration

## Current Status  
- Current phase and state
- Context validation results

## [Phase Name] (Starting/Complete ✅)
- Phase-specific information
- Validation results
- Next steps

## Pipeline Progress
- [✅/❌] Research Phase
- [✅/❌] Planning Phase  
- [✅/❌] Implementation Phase
- [✅/❌] PR Creation
```

### Error Recovery Workflow

When failures occur:

1. **Automatic Detection**: Pipeline detects and analyzes failures
2. **Context Preservation**: Decision record maintains state
3. **Recovery Guidance**: Clear instructions provided to user
4. **Retry Mechanism**: Specific retry commands available
5. **State Restoration**: Clean retry with preserved context

### Partial Completion Workflow

When partial completion is detected:

1. **Analysis**: Pipeline analyzes completion percentage
2. **Human Decision**: User decides how to proceed
3. **Context Update**: Decision recorded in decision record
4. **Continuation**: Claude receives clear instructions for remaining work

## Configuration

### Pipeline Configuration

The enhanced pipeline uses the same configuration structure with additional features:

```yaml
# .github/development-pipeline-config.yml
repo_name: "your-repo"
base_branch: "main"
thoughts_directory: "thoughts/"

validation:
  enabled: true
  strict_mode: true  # Enhanced validation
  
pipeline:
  error_recovery: true
  partial_completion_handling: true
  context_preservation: true
  
decision_record:
  auto_compression: true
  size_threshold: 150
  backup_retention: 30  # days
```

### Branch Safety Configuration

```yaml
branches:
  prefix: "feature/"
  naming: "issue-{number}-{title-slug}"
  auto_cleanup: false  # Keep branches for recovery
  validation: strict
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Decision Record Analysis

Use the decision record management script:

```bash
# Analyze decision record size and structure
python scripts/manage-decision-record.py thoughts/shared/decisions/pipeline-issue-123.md --action analyze

# Auto-manage based on size
python scripts/manage-decision-record.py thoughts/shared/decisions/pipeline-issue-123.md --auto

# Manual compression
python scripts/manage-decision-record.py thoughts/shared/decisions/pipeline-issue-123.md --action compress
```

### Pipeline State Inspection

Check pipeline state through GitHub Actions:
- View workflow runs for failure analysis
- Check decision records for context preservation
- Monitor branch state and commits
- Review error recovery attempts

## Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Trust the Recovery System**: Use provided retry commands rather than manual fixes
2. **Read Error Messages**: Enhanced error messages provide specific guidance
3. **Preserve Context**: Don't manually edit decision records
4. **Use Partial Completion Options**: Make informed decisions about partial implementations

### For Repository Maintainers

1. **Configure Thresholds**: Adjust decision record size thresholds based on team preferences
2. **Monitor Decision Records**: Regular cleanup of archived sections
3. **Review Recovery Patterns**: Identify common failure patterns for improvement
4. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure decision record backups are included in repository backups

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Branch Not Found Error:**
- Cause: Branch was manually deleted or never created
- Solution: Use `@claude restart pipeline` to recreate

**Context Validation Failed:**
- Cause: Decision record missing or corrupted
- Solution: Restore from backup or restart pipeline

**Partial Completion Not Detected:**
- Cause: Implementation plan doesn't match actual files
- Solution: Update plan or use manual completion commands

**Decision Record Too Large:**
- Cause: Long-running pipeline with many updates
- Solution: Automatic compression will be applied

### Recovery Procedures

**Complete Pipeline Recovery:**
```bash
# 1. Clean up current attempt
@claude restart pipeline

# 2. Verify clean state
# Check that branch labels are removed
# Verify no orphaned decision records

# 3. Start fresh
@claude run development pipeline
```

**Phase-Specific Recovery:**
```bash
# Research phase issues
@claude retry research

# Planning phase issues  
@claude retry planning

# Implementation phase issues
@claude retry implementation
```

## Integration with Existing Workflows

The enhanced pipeline is backward compatible with existing Phase 1 and Phase 2 implementations:

- **Validation Scripts**: All existing validation scripts work unchanged
- **Configuration**: Existing configurations are supported
- **Commands**: All existing pipeline commands continue to work
- **Templates**: Original templates remain functional

The enhanced features are additive and can be adopted incrementally.
